# Predictive Maintenance

AI-powered predictive maintenance solution for optimizing asset management and preventing equipment failures.

## Overview

The Predictive Maintenance solution uses AI to predict equipment failures before they occur, helping organizations maintain operational efficiency, reduce downtime, and extend asset lifecycles. By analyzing historical performance data, sensor readings, and maintenance records, the system can identify patterns that precede failures and recommend preventive actions.

## Components

This project contains two main components:

1. **Dashboard Demo**: An interactive dashboard that showcases predictive maintenance capabilities with visualizations of equipment health, predicted failures, and maintenance recommendations.

2. **Presentation**: A slideshow presentation explaining the technical aspects and business value of predictive maintenance.

## Key Features

- **Equipment Health Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of asset performance and health indicators
- **Failure Prediction**: AI models that predict potential failures before they occur
- **Maintenance Scheduling**: Optimized maintenance scheduling based on predictive analytics
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Tools to identify underlying causes of recurring issues
- **Cost Optimization**: Predictive insights to reduce maintenance costs and extend asset lifecycles
