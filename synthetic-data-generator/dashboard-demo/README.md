## UI/UX Design Guidelines

### Layout & Structure

- **Dashboard Layout:** Follow a modern, clean dashboard layout with a left sidebar for navigation and main content area
- **Card-Based Components:** Use card-based UI elements with consistent styling for each functional section
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure all elements adapt gracefully to different screen sizes
- **Workflow Orientation:** Design the interface to guide users through a logical workflow from configuration to generation to analysis

### Visual Design

- **Color Scheme:** 
  - Primary: Deep blues (#3730a3, #4338ca) for headers and primary actions
  - Secondary: Emerald green (#10b981) for synthetic data elements
  - Accent: Amber (#eab308) for highlights and important elements
  - Background: Light gray (#f5f5f7) for the main background
  - Cards: White (#ffffff) with subtle shadows

- **Typography:**
  - Sans-serif font family consistent with the main portal
  - Clear hierarchy with distinct heading and body text styles
  - Adequate font sizes for readability (min 14px for body text)

- **Icons & Graphics:**
  - Use Lucide icons for consistency with the main portal
  - Include data-themed illustrations and visualizations
  - Maintain a clean, professional aesthetic

### Interaction Design

- **Intuitive Controls:**
  - Sliders for numerical parameters
  - Dropdown menus for categorical selections
  - Toggle switches for binary options
  - Drag-and-drop functionality for schema building

- **Feedback Mechanisms:**
  - Real-time updates when parameters change
  - Loading indicators for generation processes
  - Success/error notifications
  - Tooltips for explaining complex concepts

- **Progressive Disclosure:**
  - Start with simplified options and allow expanding to advanced settings
  - Use accordions and tabs to organize complex information
  - Implement a step-by-step wizard for first-time users

### Accessibility & Internationalization

- **Accessibility:**
  - Ensure proper contrast ratios for text
  - Include keyboard navigation support
  - Add ARIA labels for interactive elements
  - Support screen readers

- **Multilingual Support:**
  - Implement English and Chinese language options
  - Use the same language toggle mechanism as the main portal
  - Ensure layouts accommodate text expansion in different languages

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Stack

- **Framework:** React with TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for consistent styling with the main portal
- **State Management:** React Context API or Redux for application state
- **Visualization:** D3.js or Chart.js for data visualizations
- **API Communication:** Axios for API requests

### Backend Considerations

- **API Design:** RESTful API endpoints for data generation and analysis
- **Performance:** Implement efficient data processing for larger datasets
- **Security:** Ensure secure handling of uploaded sample data

## Development Approach

1. **Phase 1: Core UI Framework**
   - Implement the basic dashboard layout and navigation
   - Create the data configuration interface
   - Set up the visualization framework

2. **Phase 2: Generation Capabilities**
   - Implement basic statistical generation methods
   - Add visualization comparisons
   - Create use case templates

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features**
   - Add advanced generation methods (GANs, etc.)
   - Implement privacy analysis tools
   - Add export functionality

4. **Phase 4: Polish & Optimization**
   - Refine UI/UX based on testing
   - Optimize performance
   - Add comprehensive help documentation

## Getting Started

```bash
# Navigate to the dashboard-demo directory
cd dashboard-demo

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

## Integration with Main Portal

The Synthetic Data Generator Demo is designed to integrate seamlessly with the main AI Data Solutions portal:

- Consistent styling and branding
- Shared authentication (if applicable)
- Unified navigation between solutions
- Complementary to the Synthetic Data Generator presentation

## Design Principles

1. **Educational Value:** The demo should help users understand synthetic data concepts
2. **Visual Clarity:** Complex data relationships should be made visually intuitive
3. **Guided Experience:** Users should feel guided through the process, not overwhelmed
4. **Practical Utility:** Focus on demonstrating real-world applications and benefits
