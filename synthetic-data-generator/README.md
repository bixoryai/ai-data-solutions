# Synthetic Data Generation

Tools for creating realistic synthetic datasets for testing and development.

## Overview

This project provides AI-powered solutions for generating synthetic data that mimics real-world datasets while preserving privacy and statistical properties.

## Features

- **Privacy-preserving Data Generation**: Create synthetic data without exposing sensitive information
- **Customizable Data Profiles**: Generate data based on specific distributions and relationships
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhance existing datasets with synthetic samples
- **Quality Validation**: Ensure synthetic data maintains the statistical properties of the original

## Components

- **Presentation**: Interactive slides explaining synthetic data generation concepts and business value
- **Dashboard Demo**: Interactive interface for generating and visualizing synthetic data
- **Generation Models**: Algorithms and models for synthetic data generation

## Presentation

The presentation component provides a comprehensive overview of synthetic data generation, including:

- Executive summary and business case
- Technical explanation of synthetic data generation
- Market analysis and competitive landscape
- Implementation roadmap and technology overview

The presentation is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and supports both English and Chinese languages.
