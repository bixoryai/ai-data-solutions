# Product Requirement Document (PRD)

## Project: NLP Data Intelligence Dashboard Demo

### Overview
The NLP Data Intelligence Dashboard is an interactive web application designed to showcase advanced AI-powered text analysis capabilities. It will provide a user-friendly interface to demonstrate features like document summarization, sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and intelligent search on sample text data. The dashboard will serve as a compelling demo for businesses looking to extract valuable insights from their unstructured text data.

---

## Goals
- Illustrate the power of NLP for text analysis and data extraction.
- Showcase a modern, intuitive, and interactive dashboard UI/UX.
- Demonstrate key NLP features using sample documents.
- Provide a solid foundation for future integration with real data sources and more advanced NLP models.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Core Layout
- Fixed header with solution title, subtitle, and language toggle.
- A clean, simple sidebar for navigation (e.g., Dashboard, Text Analysis, Search, Settings).
- Main content area designed for clear data presentation.
- Fully mobile-responsive design.

### 2. Dashboard Home (MVP)
- A welcome message providing a brief overview of the solution.
- KPI cards for key metrics, such as:
  - Documents Processed
  - Average Sentiment Score
  - Key Entities Detected
- Interactive charts:
  - Sentiment Distribution (Pie/Donut Chart)
  - Entity Frequency (Bar Chart)

### 3. Text Analysis Section
- An input area where users can paste or upload a sample document.
- **Document Summarization**: Displays a concise, AI-generated summary of the input text.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Shows the overall sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral) with a confidence score.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifies and categorizes key entities (e.g., People, Organizations, Locations, Dates).
- **Keyword Extraction**: Lists the most relevant keywords or topics from the text.

### 4. Intelligent Search Section
- A search bar to query across a pre-loaded set of sample documents.
- Search results will not just match keywords but also understand semantic meaning (for future expansion).

### 5. Settings Section
- Language toggle (English/Chinese).
- Theme toggle (optional).

## Data & Logic
- Use a pre-selected collection of sample text documents for demonstrations (e.g., news articles, product reviews).
- For the MVP, the "analysis" can be pre-computed and stored in a JSON file to simulate real-time processing.
- The Intelligent Search will perform a simple keyword search against the sample documents for the MVP.

---

## UI/UX Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling to maintain consistency with other solutions.
- Employ a clean, card-based layout for displaying analysis results.
- Ensure the design is responsive and provides a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

---

## Out of Scope (for MVP)
- Real-time analysis of user-uploaded data via a live backend model.
- User authentication and accounts.
- Saving or exporting analysis results.
- Advanced semantic or vector-based search.

---

## Success Criteria
- The dashboard runs locally and is visually consistent with other solutions in the project.
- All interactive features in the Text Analysis section work correctly with sample data.
- The application is easy to navigate, and the purpose of each feature is clear.
- The UI is fully responsive.

---

## Future Expansion
- Integrate with live NLP models via API.
- Allow users to upload their own documents for analysis.
- Implement advanced semantic search capabilities.
- Add more NLP features like topic modeling and text classification.
