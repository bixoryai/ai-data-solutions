# Product Requirements Document: Computer Vision Analytics Dashboard

**Author:** BixoryAI
**Status:** In Development
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the product requirements for the Computer Vision Analytics Dashboard, a demonstration project showcasing advanced AI capabilities for automated quality control in manufacturing environments. The dashboard will provide an interactive, user-friendly interface to visualize real-time defect detection, analyze quality trends, and understand model performance.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

- **Primary Goal**: To create a compelling and interactive demonstration that effectively showcases our expertise in building sophisticated, AI-powered computer vision solutions.
- **Secondary Goal**: To provide a standardized, reusable, and well-documented dashboard template for future computer vision projects.
- **Business Objective**: To create a powerful sales and marketing tool that clearly communicates the value and ROI of our computer vision technology to potential clients.

## 3. Target Audience

- **Primary**: Potential clients, product managers, and technical leads in the manufacturing sector.
- **Secondary**: Internal development teams, sales engineers, and marketing personnel.

## 4. Key Features & Requirements

### 4.1. **Dashboard Shell & Navigation**
- **FR-01**: The application shall use the standardized Header and Sidebar components from the `ai-data-solutions` project.
- **FR-02**: The Sidebar shall provide navigation to four main sections: "Visual Inspection," "Defect Analytics," "Model Performance," and "Use Case Simulations."
- **FR-03**: The application must be fully responsive and functional on modern desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers.
- **FR-04**: The UI shall support both English and Chinese languages, with a toggle in the header.

### 4.2. **Module 1: Visual Inspection**
- **FR-05**: The module shall display a simulated real-time video feed of products on a conveyor belt.
- **FR-06**: The system must run a client-side AI model to perform inference on the video feed.
- **FR-07**: Detected defects shall be visually highlighted on the video feed using bounding boxes and/or segmentation masks. The defect type will be displayed.
- **FR-08**: The user must be able to upload their own image or short video for analysis.

### 4.3. **Module 2: Defect Analytics**
- **FR-09**: This module shall display key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Overall Defect Rate, and Production Rate (units per hour).
- **FR-10**: An interactive line chart shall display the defect rate over a simulated time period.
- **FR-11**: A Pareto chart shall be displayed, showing the frequency of different defect types, sorted from highest to lowest.
- **FR-12**: A product heatmap shall visually represent the most common physical locations of defects on a 2D schematic of the product.

### 4.4. **Module 3: Model Performance**
- **FR-13**: The module must display real-time metrics for the AI model, including Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
- **FR-14**: An interactive confusion matrix shall be provided to visualize the model's classification accuracy.
- **FR-15**: Users must be able to view and compare ROC curves for different model versions (simulated).

### 4.5. **Module 4: Use Case & ROI Simulator**
- **FR-16**: The module shall provide interactive sliders or input fields for the user to adjust simulation parameters (e.g., production speed, defect frequency).
- **FR-17**: A dynamic ROI calculator must estimate potential cost savings based on user inputs (e.g., labor costs, current scrap rate).
- **FR-18**: The output of the simulation should clearly visualize the financial and operational impact of the AI solution.

## 5. Technical Requirements

- **TR-01**: The frontend shall be built using React with TypeScript.
- **TR-02**: All styling shall be implemented using Tailwind CSS.
- **TR-03**: The client-side AI model will be run using TensorFlow.js or ONNX Runtime.
- **TR-04**: All data visualizations shall be created using the Recharts library.
- **TR-05**: The application must adhere to the coding standards and development practices outlined in the main repository's `development-guide.md`.

## 6. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for V1)

- Integration with live camera feeds via WebRTC.
- User authentication and saving/loading of simulation scenarios.
- A/B testing framework for comparing live models.
- 3D model rendering for defect heatmaps.
