# Product Requirement Document (PRD): Supply Chain Intelligence Dashboard

## 1. Overview
The Supply Chain Intelligence Dashboard is an interactive web application demonstrating the power of AI in modern logistics and supply chain management. It will provide a visually compelling, "mission control" style view of a fictional global supply chain, showcasing how AI can provide real-time visibility, predict disruptions, and recommend intelligent solutions.

---

## 2. Goals
- **Illustrate Value:** Clearly demonstrate how AI-powered analytics can optimize supply chains, reduce risks, and improve efficiency.
- **Showcase AI in Action:** Move beyond static charts to show a dynamic system where AI actively provides insights and recommendations.
- **Engage and Educate:** Create a memorable, interactive experience that allows users to explore the capabilities of the system.
- **Maintain Consistency:** Adhere to the established UI/UX standards of the AI Data Solutions project.

## 3. Target User Persona
**Name:** Sarah, a Supply Chain Manager at a global electronics company.
**Goals:** Sarah needs to monitor shipments, manage inventory across multiple regions, anticipate disruptions, and make quick, data-driven decisions to prevent costly delays.
**Frustrations:** Lack of a single, unified view of the entire supply chain; reactive, manual problem-solving; difficulty in forecasting demand and supplier issues.

## 4. Key Features

### 4.1. Global Dashboard (The "Mission Control" View)
This will be the landing page and the heart of the demo.
- **Live Scenario Map:** An interactive world map showing simulated real-time movement of assets (ships, planes, trucks).
  - Shipments are clickable to reveal details (ID, contents, ETA, status).
  - Routes are color-coded based on AI-assessed risk levels (e.g., green for on-time, amber for potential delay, red for critical alert).
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** A top-level summary of supply chain health.
  - **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Overall percentage of shipments meeting their deadlines.
  - **Inventory Turnover:** Efficiency of inventory management.
  - **Landed Cost per Unit:** Total cost of getting a product to the customer.
  - **Active Risk Alerts:** A live count of AI-detected potential disruptions.

### 4.2. AI Insight & Recommendation Engine
A core feature integrated across multiple views.
- **Contextual Insights:** Next to key charts or alerts, a panel will display plain-language text generated by a simulated AI.
- **Actionable Recommendations:** The panel will propose specific actions to mitigate risks or capitalize on opportunities.
  - *Example:* "AI Alert: Severe weather is forecast at the Port of Singapore in 48 hours. **Recommendation:** Reroute Ship-789 via the Strait of Malacca. This adds 12 hours to the journey but avoids a potential 3-day delay."

### 4.3. Disruption Simulator (Interactive Demo Component)
A key feature for demonstrating resilience and AI value.
- **User-Triggered Events:** A small control panel will allow users to trigger simulated events like:
  - `[Port Closure]`
  - `[Supplier Factory Fire]`
  - `[Unexpected Demand Spike]`
- **Real-Time Response:** When an event is triggered, the dashboard will dynamically update. The map will show rerouted shipments, KPI charts will reflect the impact, and the AI Insight engine will generate a new response plan.

### 4.4. Navigation & Pages
The sidebar will provide navigation to focused views.
- **Dashboard:** The main "Mission Control" view.
- **Demand & Inventory:**
  - AI-powered demand forecasting charts for different regions/products.
  - Inventory level visualizations across various warehouses.
- **Supplier Performance:**
  - Scorecards for key suppliers (on-time rate, quality score).
  - AI-driven risk assessment for each supplier.

---

## 5. UI/UX & Non-Functional Requirements
- Follow all guidelines from `docs/development-guide/dashboard-ui-standard.md`.
- The application must be fully mobile responsive.
- Transitions and animations (especially on the map) should be smooth to create a fluid, modern feel.

---

## 6. Out of Scope (for this Version)
- Real backend or live data integration (all data will be simulated).
- User authentication and accounts.
- The ability to save or export reports.

---

## 7. Success Criteria
- The dashboard successfully loads and runs locally.
- The Live Scenario Map is interactive and visually communicates the status of the supply chain.
- The Disruption Simulator provides a clear, powerful demonstration of the AI's value.
- The user experience is intuitive, engaging, and consistent with the project's brand.
