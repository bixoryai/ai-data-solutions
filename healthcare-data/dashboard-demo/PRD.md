## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document outlines the product requirements for the AI-Powered Healthcare Analytics Dashboard. The purpose of this interactive demo is to showcase the transformative capabilities of Artificial Intelligence in a healthcare context, demonstrating tangible value to potential clients and stakeholders.

### 1.2. Scope
The project scope includes the design, development, and implementation of a web-based dashboard with four distinct, AI-powered feature modules. The backend AI models will be simulated for this demo, with the focus being on creating a compelling and realistic user experience that clearly communicates the power of the underlying technology.

### 1.3. Target Audience
This demo is designed for:
-   **Hospital Administrators & C-Suite Executives:** To demonstrate potential ROI, operational efficiencies, and improved patient outcomes.
-   **Clinicians & Department Heads:** To showcase tools that can augment their diagnostic process and reduce administrative burden.
-   **Data Scientists & IT Professionals:** To illustrate the technical capabilities and potential for integration.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

-   **Primary Goal:** To create a powerful sales and marketing tool that effectively demonstrates the value proposition of our AI healthcare solutions.
-   **Objective 1:** Clearly visualize how AI can predict future events (e.g., readmissions, disease outbreaks).
-   **Objective 2:** Showcase the ability of AI to accelerate and enhance complex diagnostic tasks (e.g., medical image analysis).
-   **Objective 3:** Demonstrate AI's power to extract structured insights from unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes).
-   **Objective 4:** Provide an interactive experience for users to understand the impact of AI on operational efficiency.

## 3. Feature Requirements

The dashboard will be organized around a central navigation sidebar allowing access to the following four modules:

### 3.1. Module 1: Predictive Analytics Dashboard
This will be the default view, providing a high-level overview of hospital operations with predictive insights.
-   **FR 1.1: Patient Readmission Risk:**
    -   Display a list of current patients with a color-coded "Readmission Risk Score" (Low, Medium, High) calculated by a simulated AI model.
    -   Allow users to click on a patient to see a mock profile with the factors contributing to their risk score.
-   **FR 1.2: Disease Outbreak Forecasting:**
    -   Display an interactive map of the region.
    -   The map will show AI-generated hotspots indicating a higher probability of disease outbreaks (e.g., influenza) in the coming weeks.
-   **FR 1.3: AI-Driven KPIs:**
    -   Display key metrics (e.g., Bed Occupancy, Avg. Length of Stay) with a historical trend line and an AI-generated forecast for the next 7 days.
    -   The system will flag any metrics that are trending towards an anomalous or concerning state.

### 3.2. Module 2: AI-Assisted Medical Image Analysis (Simulation)
A module to demonstrate AI's role in diagnostic imaging.
-   **FR 2.1: Image Selection:**
    -   Provide a gallery of pre-selected medical images (e.g., chest X-rays, brain MRIs).
-   **FR 2.2: AI Analysis Simulation:**
    -   Upon selecting an image, a user can click "Analyze with AI."
    -   The UI will show a progress indicator, followed by the image being displayed with highlighted regions (bounding boxes or heatmaps) indicating potential AI-detected anomalies.
    -   A summary report will list the findings (e.g., "Suspected Nodule," "Possible Fracture") with a simulated confidence score for each.

### 3.3. Module 3: NLP for Clinical Intelligence
A module to showcase the power of Natural Language Processing on unstructured clinical text.
-   **FR 3.1: Clinical Note Summarizer:**
    -   Display a sample of a long, unstructured clinical note.
    -   A button, "Generate Summary," will trigger an AI process that produces a structured summary, extracting key entities like `Symptoms`, `Medications`, `Dosages`, and `Diagnoses`.
-   **FR 3.2: Patient Feedback Analysis:**
    -   Display a dashboard of patient feedback from mock surveys.
    -   The AI will categorize comments and display overall sentiment trends (Positive, Neutral, Negative) related to different hospital departments or services.

### 3.4. Module 4: Resource Optimization Simulator
An interactive tool for administrative planning.
-   **FR 4.1: Interactive Controls:**
    -   Provide sliders or input fields for variables like "Number of Nurses on Ward A," "OR Scheduling Capacity," etc.
-   **FR 4.2: AI-Predicted Outcomes:**
    -   As the user adjusts the variables, a set of predicted outcome metrics will update in real-time.
    -   Predicted outcomes will include: `Average Patient Wait Time`, `Staff Burnout Risk`, and `Projected Operational Cost`.

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

-   **NFR 1: User Interface:** The UI must be clean, modern, intuitive, and consistent with the established `dashboard-ui-standard.md`.
-   **NFR 2: Performance:** The application must be fast and responsive, with simulated AI processes completing within 2-3 seconds to maintain user engagement.
-   **NFR 3: Responsiveness:** The dashboard must be fully responsive and functional on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## 5. Assumptions

-   All AI models and their outputs are simulated. No real predictive modeling will occur in the front-end demo.
-   All data used (patient names, medical images, clinical notes) is synthetic and anonymized, containing no real patient information.
-   The focus is on demonstrating the *art of the possible*, not on building a production-ready system.
