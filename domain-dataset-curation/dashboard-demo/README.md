  - Drag-and-drop functionality for data mapping
  - Interactive data quality scorecards
  - Contextual tooltips for industry-specific terminology

- **Feedback Mechanisms:**
  - Real-time data quality indicators
  - Progress tracking for curation workflows
  - Success/error notifications with domain-specific guidance
  - Before/after comparisons to show curation impact

- **Progressive Disclosure:**
  - Start with high-level domain overview
  - Allow drilling down into specific data elements
  - Reveal advanced options for expert users
  - Guided tours for first-time users based on their industry role

### Accessibility & Internationalization

- **Accessibility:**
  - Ensure proper contrast ratios for text
  - Include keyboard navigation support
  - Add ARIA labels for interactive elements
