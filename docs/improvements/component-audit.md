# Component Audit: AI Data Solutions

This document contains a comprehensive audit of the components used across the four implemented solutions in the AI Data Solutions platform: Industry Analytics, Synthetic Data Generator, Domain Dataset Curation, and Predictive Maintenance.

## Audit Purpose

The main objectives of this audit are to:
1. Identify components that appear in multiple solutions
2. Document implementation patterns, props, and functionality
3. Identify inconsistencies and variations
4. Establish requirements for standardized components

## Common Components Identified

### 1. Header Component

| Solution | File Location | Implementation | Props |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| Industry Analytics | IndustryAIAnalyticsDashboard.jsx | Embedded in main component | `activeTab`, `setActiveTab`, `t`, `language`, `changeLanguage` |
| Synthetic Data Generator | components/Header.tsx | Standalone component | `language`, `toggleLanguage`, `goToHome`, `toggleSidebar` |
| Domain Dataset Curation | components/Header.tsx | Standalone component | `language`, `toggleLanguage`, `goToHome`, `selectedDomain` |
| Predictive Maintenance | components/Header.tsx | Standalone component | `language`, `toggleLanguage`, `goToHome`, `selectedSector` |

#### Key Findings:
- Industry Analytics implements header as part of a larger component rather than standalone
- 3 of 4 solutions use TypeScript with proper interfaces
- 3 of 4 solutions have consistent prop patterns
- Visual styles differ significantly between implementations
- Language toggle functionality varies between solutions
- Portal navigation implementation is inconsistent

### 2. Sidebar Component

| Solution | File Location | Implementation | Props |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| Industry Analytics | IndustryAIAnalyticsDashboard.jsx | Embedded in NavigationButton component | `icon`, `label`, `isActive`, `onClick` |
| Synthetic Data Generator | components/Sidebar.tsx | Standalone component | `navItems`, `activeSection`, `setActiveSection`, `language`, `isOpen`, `goToHome` |
| Domain Dataset Curation | components/Sidebar.tsx | Standalone component | `activeSection`, `setActiveSection`, `language`, `goToHome` |
| Predictive Maintenance | components/Sidebar.tsx | Standalone component | `activeSection`, `setActiveSection`, `language`, `goToHome` |

#### Key Findings:
- Industry Analytics uses a different pattern from the other solutions
- 3 of 4 solutions have similar prop structures but with small variations
- Navigation items structured differently across solutions
- Visual styling inconsistent (some dark, some light themes)
- Return Home functionality similar but implemented differently

### 3. Language Toggle

| Solution | File Location | Implementation | Storage |
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Industry Analytics | IndustryAIAnalyticsDashboard.jsx | Custom buttons | localStorage with 'dashboard_language' key |
| Synthetic Data Generator | components/Header.tsx | Embedded in header | localStorage with 'language' key |
| Domain Dataset Curation | components/Header.tsx | Button in header | localStorage (key not identified) |
| Predictive Maintenance | components/Header.tsx | Button in header | localStorage (key not identified) |

#### Key Findings:
- All solutions implement language toggle but with different UIs
- Inconsistent localStorage key naming
- Translation handling varies from inline objects to imported files
- Toggle UI placement differs between implementations

## Data Flow Patterns

### State Management

| Solution | Language State | Navigation State | Data Fetching |
|----------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| Industry Analytics | useState in main component | Tab-based navigation | Simulated data |
| Synthetic Data Generator | useState in App.tsx | Section-based navigation | Static data |
| Domain Dataset Curation | useState in App.tsx | Section-based navigation | Static data |
| Predictive Maintenance | useState in App.tsx | Section-based navigation | Static data |

### User Preferences

| Solution | Storage Mechanism | Preferences Stored |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Industry Analytics | localStorage | language |
| Synthetic Data Generator | localStorage | language |
| Domain Dataset Curation | localStorage | language |
| Predictive Maintenance | localStorage | language |

## Visual Design Patterns

### Color Schemes

| Solution | Primary Colors | Background | Header Style |
|----------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| Industry Analytics | Blues/Indigo | Dark (bg-gray-900) | Gradient background |
| Synthetic Data Generator | Blues/Primary | Light (bg-gray-50) | Gradient background |
| Domain Dataset Curation | Blues/Grays | Light (bg-gray-50) | White with shadow |
| Predictive Maintenance | Blues/Grays | Light (bg-gray-50) | White with shadow |

### UI Components

| Solution | Cards | Buttons | Icons |
|----------|------|---------|-------|
| Industry Analytics | Custom styling | Custom components | Lucide |
| Synthetic Data Generator | Tailwind classes | Tailwind classes | Lucide |
| Domain Dataset Curation | Tailwind classes | Tailwind classes | Lucide |
| Predictive Maintenance | Tailwind classes | Tailwind classes | Lucide |

## Recommendations for Standardization

Based on this audit, the following components should be prioritized for standardization:

1. **Header Component**
   - Create standardized interfaces with consistent props
   - Support customization for solution-specific elements
   - Unify language toggle implementation

2. **Sidebar Component**
   - Standardize navigation item structure
   - Create consistent styling (light theme recommended)
   - Implement consistent home navigation

3. **Language Toggle**
   - Create a standalone component with consistent interface
   - Standardize localStorage key naming
   - Implement consistent translation management

4. **Navigation Utilities**
   - Create a shared utility for consistent portal navigation
   - Standardize URL handling across deployment environments

## Next Steps

1. Create component specifications document with interface definitions
2. Implement first shared component (Header) with full test coverage
3. Begin integration into one solution while maintaining functionality

### Predictive Maintenance
Predictive Maintenance now matches the UI/UX standard for header, sidebar, and toggle logic. Sidebar toggle, header/sidebar layout, and main content alignment have been audited and fixed. All dashboards now use the same pattern for sidebar toggle and layout.
