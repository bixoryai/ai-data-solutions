## Implementation Details

The presentation is built as a self-contained React component with custom styling:

- **React-based Implementation** (`src/components/Presentation.tsx`)
  - Modern functional React component using hooks
  - Custom animations and transitions
  - Keyboard navigation support (arrow keys)
  - Interactive tab system with state management

- **Styling** (`src/components/Presentation.css`)
  - Custom CSS with modern styling techniques
  - Responsive design that works on various screen sizes
  - Animations, gradients, and glassmorphism effects
  - Optimized layouts for different content types

## Slide Structure

The presentation consists of the following slides:

1. **Title Slide** - Introduction with company branding and tagline
2. **The Opportunity** - Key market statistics and industry-specific AI value propositions
3. **Key Business Challenges We Solve** - Pain points addressed by the solution
4. **Our AI-First Approach** - Solution overview with cross-industry AI capabilities
5. **Industry-Specific AI Applications** - Interactive tabs showing solutions for different industries
6. **Seamless Enterprise Integration** - AI enhancement capabilities that integrate with existing systems
7. **The 90-Day Journey to Value** - Timeline showing the implementation journey

## UI Features

## Code Architecture

The presentation follows a modular approach:

- **Shared Structure** - Common layout elements used across all slides (backgrounds, headers)
- **Namespaced CSS** - Each new slide (7+) uses prefixed CSS classes to prevent style conflicts
- **Data-Driven Content** - Content arrays drive the rendering of repeated elements
- **Consistent Styling** - Unified color scheme, typography, and interactive elements
- **Isolated Slide Logic** - Each slide can be modified without affecting others
